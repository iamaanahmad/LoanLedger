## 📝 RECORDING TIPS

1. **Screen Resolution**: Record at 1920x1080 for clarity
2. **Mouse Movements**: Move slowly and deliberately so viewers can follow
3. **Pauses**: Brief pauses after clicking help viewers process what happened
4. **Tone**: Confident but conversational — you're talking to banking professionals, not reading a script
5. **Timing**: Practice to hit ~3 minutes. Judges appreciate conciseness.

## 🎤 VOICE TIPS

- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Emphasize key numbers: "T+7", "40+ hours", "$1.4 trillion"
- Sound enthusiastic about the solution, not salesy
- End with confidence

## 📱 RECOMMENDED TOOLS

- **Screen Recording**: OBS Studio (free), Loom, or Camtasia
- **Editing**: DaVinci Resolve (free) or Adobe Premiere
