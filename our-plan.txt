Project Idea: LoanLedger – A Transparent Loan Trading Dashboard
A desktop-based prototype that allows banks, institutions, and even fintech startups to view, trade, and track loans with full transparency.

🏆 Challenge to Achieve
Problem: Loan trading today is opaque, slow, and prone to inefficiencies.

Goal: Build a system that makes loan trading as clear and trackable as stock trading, with real-time visibility and audit trails.

Impact: Judges (banking experts) see how this reduces risk, increases liquidity, and standardizes processes across institutions.

🔑 Features to Implement
